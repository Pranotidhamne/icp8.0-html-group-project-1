            <p>One of the best India seam bowlers available, Mohammad Shami was bought by Gujarat Titans for INR 6.25 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Mohammed Shami revived his limited-overs career with some stellar performances in India colours in recent months and was picked up by Punjab Kings for a hefty price tag of INR 4.8 crore at the 2019 Player Auction Shami was leading the PBKS pace attack . He has the skills to be effective both at the start of the innings and also in the death overs. Shami’s progress has been terrific and he is now a complete bowler and batsmen will need to be wary against him. He had a fine run in 2019 and finished the season as KXIP’s highest wicket-taker with 19 wickets from 14 games. His bowling got even better in the 2020 season where he defended six runs in a super-over through his incredible consistency and struck early with the new ball for PBKS throughout the 13th edition. This season Shami is all set to don the Gujarat Titans jersey and his experience with the new ball will be vital.</p>
